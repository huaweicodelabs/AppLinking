2. Use your account to sign in to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-get-started), create a project and add an Android app.

   When creating an Android app, the recommended packageName format is **com.xxxx** to avoid complex packageName change steps.


3. Select your project and app in My projects, and go to "Grow > App Linking" to enable the App Linking service.

5. Select Project Settings,and go to Manage APIs, enable the App Linking Service.
6. Go to General information, download the **agconnect-services.json** file and add it to the "./android/app" directory of the project directory.

    ``` bash
   # install General dependencies
    npm install

    # install App Linking SDK dependencies
    npm install @react-native-agconnect/applinking
